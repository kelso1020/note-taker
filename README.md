## Description

I used express.js to make this note-taking app open and function properly.

## Usage

The first page of this Note-Taker app displays a 'Get Started' button. When clicked, a new web page loads that shows an input field for Title and Text. When data is entered into the input field, a save button appears at the top right of the webpage. When the save button is clicked, the note is added to the list at the left side of the page. The list items are clickable which allows the user to review list items after they are saved. Each list item is also accompanied with a trashcan icon, which will delete the respective list item when clicked.
